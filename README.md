# Welcome to myplace. 

This is a small interactive project built with React.

## Instructions

To run this project locally: 
* Start by cloning the repo with `git clone https://github.com/filipe-gomes/myplace.git`
* Then `cd myplace` to go into the project's directory
* From here, install all dependencies with `yarn`
* Once it's done install, you can run the app in development mode with `yarn start`
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Testing

Run `yarn test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
You can see test results in the terminal.

### Storybook-ing

Run `yarn storybook` to run storybook locally and test each component individually. Try using storybook's controls and changing the props to see what you can do.

### Notes

This is a small project built over a couple days to showcase my methods for coding in React. It contains some of the best practices I try to follow, like component level documentation using `JSDocs`, as well as type checking with `PropTypes`. 
I also got out of my comfort zone a little and decided to use bootstrap and css modules, even though I'm most comfortable with material-ui and styled components.

Most links will dead end to `#`. However the following links are functional, try them out:
* Home
* Blog
* Send Message

You will also find that clicking on these buttons will result in some actions:
* Add to Friends
* View Filipe's Friends

If you're curious the famous person in the picture is, it is a face swap between two of the funniest celebrities I know: Eric Andre && Danny DeVito
