### Testing

Run `yarn test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
You can see test results in the terminal.

### Storybook-ing

Run `yarn storybook` to run storybook locally and play with each component individually. Try using storybook's controls and changing the props to see what you can do.

### Notes

This is a small project built over a couple days to showcase my methods for coding in React. It contains some of the best practices I try to follow, like component level documentation using `JSDocs`, as well as type checking with `PropTypes` and writing tests for all components.\
I also got out of my comfort zone a little and decided to use bootstrap and css modules, even though I'm most comfortable with material-ui and styled components.

Most links will dead end to `#`. However the following links are functional, try them out:

You will also find that clicking on these buttons will result in some actions:

If you're curious who the famous person in the picture is, it is actually a face swap between two of my favorite comedians: Eric Andre `&&` Danny DeVito
